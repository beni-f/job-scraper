Currently, NEWA has 38 member associations/organizations operating all over the country whose primary objective is creating an enabling environment for the empowerment of Ethiopian women and girls. Its member associations aim to advance women’s rights, gender equality, and women’s empowerment in Ethiopia. NEWA has experience in leading women’s rights issues in Ethiopia through advocacy, research, capacity building, and monitoring government compliance with Gender Equality. As a network organization, NEWA has been advocating for the development and proper implementation of gender-sensitive policies, laws, and programs at the national and regional levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the international community's strong commitment to the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda, as enshrined in landmark resolutions like UNSCR 1325, and the tireless efforts of Ethiopian civil society organizations (CSOs) to promote the WPS agenda, including the pursuit of a National Action Plan, women remain notably absent from formal peace negotiations in Ethiopia. This exclusion, exemplified by their absence from critical peace talks, represents a significant gap, particularly given the documented impact of conflict on women and girls and the crucial role they play in peacebuilding and reconciliation. This absence highlights a critical disconnect between policy commitments to WPS and the realities on the ground.</p><p>This gap persists despite the valuable contributions of many organizations like the Network of Ethiopian Women's Associations (NEWA) to advancing the WPS agenda in Ethiopia. NEWA has implemented impactful initiatives that demonstrate the potential for women's leadership in peacebuilding. Their work includes empowering women peace builders through capacity building and grassroots initiatives, fostering dialogue and peacebuilding through culturally relevant projects like \"Buna Le Selam\" (Coffee for Peace), and advocating for women's inclusion in transitional justice processes and national dialogues. These efforts highlight the crucial role women play in fostering a more peaceful and just future for Ethiopia.</p><p>However, despite these important contributions and the clear evidence demonstrating the positive impact of women's participation in peacebuilding, women continue to be excluded from formal peace negotiations. This persistent exclusion reveals a systemic challenge that goes beyond the valuable work being done by organizations like NEWA. It suggests that deeper structural barriers, including political will, cultural norms, and entrenched power dynamics, continue to hinder women's meaningful participation in formal peace processes.</p><p>The challenge, therefore, lies not only in supporting the work of CSOs, but in addressing the underlying systemic factors that prevent these policies and initiatives from translating into tangible improvements in women's participation at the highest levels of peace and security decision-making. NEWA, in partnership with ACCORD and AWPSI, with financial support from FCDO, is implementing a project advancing the WPS agenda through a national focus, tailoring their approaches to meet the specific needs of Ethiopian women. As part of this project, NEWA intends to conduct an assessment to identify the challenges and opportunities in Ethiopia. This assessment will aim address the challenges, including recommendations for changes to improve the work of CSOs and, more importantly, address the systemic factors hindering women's participation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>General Objective</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The primary objective of this work is to conduct a comprehensive baseline assessment on the opportunities and key challenges facing the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda at grassroot in Ethiopia</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Objectives of the Assessment</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>To identify and discuss existing opportunities at grass root level that can be leveraged to advance WPS implementation in Ethiopia.</li><li>&nbsp;To identify the key challenges hindering the effective implementation of the WPS agenda at national and grassroot level.</li><li>To develop specific and actionable recommendations for a range of stakeholders, including the government, CSOs, international organizations, and communities to strengthen WPS implementation and ensure that women's voices are effectively included in all peace and secure ty efforts in Ethiopia.</li><li>To Map Women’s Rights Organizations (WROs) and grassroot peace building actors working on different regions</li><li>To produce policy brief related to WPS challenges and opportunity in Ethiopia</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Scope of Work</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The scope of this assessment is designed to be comprehensive and focused, providing a thorough understanding of the challenges and opportunities related to the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda in Ethiopia targeting grassroot peace actors and national level actors. It will delve into the complexities of WPS implementation, acknowledging the interplay of various factors that influence women's participation in peace and security.</p><p>The geographical scope of the assessment will center on Ethiopia in general, taking into account the unique context and dynamics present within the nation. Although it is</p><p>important to recognize that conflict and peacebuilding initiatives may have regional consequences, the main emphasis will be on the national level, analyzing policies, practices, and experiences that occur within the confines of Ethiopia.</p><p>Thematically, the assessment will center on the core pillars of the WPS agenda, including:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;Participation: This will be a key area of focus, specifically examining women's inclusion in formal peace negotiations, but also considering their involvement in other peacebuilding activities, such as conflict resolution, mediation, and post-conflict reconstruction. The assessment will explore the barriers that prevent women from accessing these spaces and the factors that enable their participation.</li><li>Protection: The assessment will consider the protection of women and girls from conflict-related violence, including sexual and gender-based violence. It will explore the existing protection mechanisms and identify gaps and areas for improvement.</li><li>&nbsp;Prevention: Understanding the root causes of conflict and promoting peace are crucial aspects of the WPS agenda. This assessment will examine efforts to prevent conflict and build peace, considering the role of women in these initiatives and how their contributions can be strengthened.</li><li><p>Relief and Recovery: The assessment will also touch upon the specific needs of women in post-conflict settings, including access to humanitarian assistance, economic empowerment, and justice and reconciliation processes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Methodology of the Assessment</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Methodologically, the assessment will employ a mixed-methods approach. This means it will gather data from a variety of sources, including:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Document Review</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>&nbsp;Existing policies, reports /UN women report, UK-FCDO report/, academic studies, and other relevant documents related to WPS in Ethiopia will be reviewed to understand the policy landscape and identify existing evidence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>Key Informant Interviews</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Interviews will be conducted with key stakeholders, including government officials, representatives from CSOs (particularly women's organizations like NEWA), international organizations, grassroot women peace actors, community leaders, and importantly, women themselves who have experience in peacebuilding and conflict. These interviews will gather diverse perspectives and insights on the challenges and opportunities related to WPS implementation.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Focus Group Discussions</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>&nbsp;Focus groups will be held with women in different communities to explore their experiences, perspectives, and priorities related to peace and security. This will ensure that the voices of women at the grassroots level are heard and incorporated into the assessment.</li></ul><p>Finally, the assessment will be forward-looking, aiming to provide practical and actionable recommendations. It will not only identify the problems but also propose concrete solutions and strategies for strengthening WPS implementation in Ethiopia. These recommendations will be targeted towards different stakeholders, empowering them to take concrete steps towards achieving gender equality in women peace and security. The assessment will be a valuable tool for NEWA, ACCORD, AWPSI, and other actors working to advance the WPS agenda in Ethiopia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Deliverables</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The consultant will deliver the following outputs within the specified timeframe:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;Inception Report: Within five days of the agreement signing date.

Its primary goal is to enhance the capacity and equitable involvement of all participants in the humanitarian system through a scalable, adaptable network solution. The project will engage local and national networks in countries such as DRC, Ethiopia, Iraq, Myanmar, Nigeria, and South Sudan, with a focus on marginalized groups, including organizations led by women and refugees. Local-SPACE consists of two main components. The first aims to strengthen the institutional capacity and humanitarian leadership of Local and National Actors(L/NAs). This will involve supporting national/ sub-national networks and collaborating with local NGOs, community-based organizations (CBOs), and grassroots groups at three levels: individual (through leadership coaching and mentoring),organizational (enhancing institutional capacity), and network (facilitating capacity sharing). Customized capacity-strengthening workshops and a learning portal will provide ongoing education and resource sharing. The second component emphasizes evidence-based advocacy and the replication of successful models. This includes engaging L/NAs with coordination mechanisms, developing advocacy strategies, and producing an action research report. The project will host workshops to document lessons learned and promote methodologies at international forums. To ensure long-term sustainability, Local-SPACE will create a fundraising strategy to support national platforms and help local actors access funding.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The implementation of Local-SPACE in Ethiopia will be carried out by CST in collaboration with a consortium led globally by DanChurchAid and in partnership with Save the Children UK/Humanitarian Leadership Academy.

We are committed to creating demand for and access to health information, services, supplies, and eco­nomic empowerment for youth. We achieve this by engaging in advocacy, capacity development and reproductive health initiatives, so that young people are empowered to lead healthy and self-determined lives.DSW has been working in Ethiopia for about two decades and half focusing on adolescent and young people sexual and reproductive health program in collaboration with government, international and local partners at different levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>DSW Ethiopia is implementing various projects across Ethiopia, particularly in Oromia, Amhara, Sidama, Central Ethiopia, South Ethiopia, Afar, Somali and Addis Ababa in collaboration with different developmental partners and maintains a strong network of partners ranging from community-based structures, local government offices to national and international NGOs and federal ministries. Currently&nbsp;DSW Ethiopia is initiating the implementation of a new project titled “<strong>Integrated Approach: Sexual and Reproductive Health and Livelihood Empowerment of Young People for Positive Coexistence with their Environment in Bishoftu City, Oromia Region</strong>.” This initiative is a four-year project, running from January 2025 to December 2028.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Project Background</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Ethiopia is grappling with rapid population growth, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas like Bishoftu. This surge presents significant challenges to sustainable development, especially for the youth—particularly young women. High unemployment rates, insufficient sexual and reproductive health (SRH) knowledge, and limited economic opportunities contribute to poverty and social exclusion, forcing many young people into informal and often unsafe livelihoods. Consequently, their vulnerability to SRH challenges such as teenage pregnancies, HIV, and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) increases.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Despite the Ministry of Health's National Adolescents and Youth Health Strategy (2021-2025), which seeks to enhance access to quality SRH information and services, adolescents continue to face numerous barriers. Emerging health threats and preventable causes of morbidity and mortality are prevalent due to the limited availability of comprehensive SRH services. The National Reproductive Health Strategy highlights significant gaps, with many young people lacking access to essential information, contraceptives, and youth-friendly services. This scarcity leads to early and unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and unsafe abortions among adolescents. Alarmingly, only 37% of women aged 15-19 and 52% of those aged 20-24 utilize contraception in Ethiopia.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">High rates of early and unintended pregnancies further complicate the situation. The 2019 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) revealed that approximately 29% of girls aged 15-19 have either given birth or are pregnant with their first child. Early pregnancies pose significant health risks for young mothers and their babies while adversely affecting educational and economic opportunities.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Gender inequalities and harmful traditional practices exacerbate these issues. Cultural norms like child marriage and female genital mutilation disproportionately affect young girls, with the median age at first marriage being just 17.8 years, perpetuating cycles of poor health outcomes.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In addition to SRH challenges, the environmental problems in Bishoftu significantly impact community well-being. Rapid urbanization has led to deforestation, loss of wetlands, and pollution affecting local lakes and fertile land. Inadequate waste management exacerbates these issues, as increased waste from urban populations contributes to environmental degradation. Many residents lack awareness of the importance of conservation, further threatening ecological sustainability. The depletion of natural resources limits agricultural productivity and exacerbates poverty, particularly affecting youth who rely on these resources for livelihoods.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">To tackle these interconnected challenges, integrated interventions focusing on SRH, environmental sustainability, and livelihood opportunities are essential. This project aims to enhance SRH services, improve socio-economic conditions, and promote environmental conservation in Bishoftu. By empowering young people, particularly women, to take control of their reproductive health and engage in sustainable livelihoods, these efforts will contribute to Ethiopia’s national development goals and align with global commitments like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Ultimately, this holistic approach will pave the way for a more prosperous and sustainable future for Bishoftu and its communities.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PROJECT GOAL, OBJECTIVES and INDICATORS</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Project Goal:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br>Contribute to the improvement of the socio economic well-being and health of young people who coexist positively with their natural environment through integrated interventions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>General Objective:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br>Improved access to SRH information &amp;services, livelihood opportunities and their engagement in environmental protection for 72,170 young people through enhancing their knowledge and practices in Bishoftu City of Oromia region by 2028</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Specific Objectives:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reach 72,170 young people aged 15-29 with comprehensive SRH information by 2028.</p><p>Enable 13,000 young people to access and utilize adolescent-friendly SRH services through referral linkages and outreach.</p><p>Improve the socio-economic situations of 132 youth and young women through targeted training and support in income-generating activities by 2028.</p><p>Enhance environmental protection practices through awareness campaigns and planting 40,000 seedlings by 2028.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>Expected Results</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The expected results of the project can be broken down based on its key components SRH information and services, socio-economic empowerment, and environmental protection.

These events have resulted in thousands of victims who have suffered from violence, forced displacement, torture, and other forms of abuse. As Ethiopia embarks on a transitional justice process aimed at reconciling these past injustices, it is crucial to provide support for victims who are often left marginalized and without access to the care and services they need.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In post-conflict and transitional justice settings, victims’ support groups are widely recognized as a vital mechanism for providing the necessary care and advocacy that victims require. These groups serve multiple functions, from providing psychological and emotional support to advocating for legal remedies, social services, and policy reforms that address victims' needs. They also offer a collective voice for victims in transitional justice processes, ensuring that their stories are heard and that justice efforts are inclusive and equitable.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Ethiopia has not a comprehensive &nbsp;mechanisms to consistently address the needs of victims of human rights abuses. While some civil society organizations and community initiatives offer limited support, there is no national framework or organized support system for victims, particularly those affected by&nbsp; conflicts and political upheaval. Without such mechanisms, many victims remain isolated and unable to access the help they require, whether in the form of trauma counseling, legal aid, or assistance with rebuilding their lives.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The establishment of victims’ groups in Ethiopia presents an opportunity to address these gaps. Such groups can provide a safe space for victims to share their experiences, offer peer support, and advocate for justice and reparations. Additionally, these groups can help bridge the gap between victims and formal justice processes, ensuring that victims are aware of their rights and can participate meaningfully in the broader transitional justice framework. The involvement of victims in transitional justice processes not only contributes to healing but also promotes social cohesion and long-term peace by addressing the root causes of conflict.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">International experience shows that victims' groups are most effective when they are tailored to the cultural, social, and political contexts in which they operate. Therefore, it is essential to design a model for Ethiopia that takes into account the country’s unique social fabric, ethnic diversity, and historical challenges. Furthermore, the success of such groups relies on proper legal frameworks, strong institutional backing, sustainable funding, and close collaboration with civil society and international actors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The proposed study aims to explore the options for strengthening or outlining mechanisms for establishment of victims’ groups in Ethiopia. It will assess the needs of victims, review successful models from other post-conflict countries, and propose a set of recommendations that are practical and sustainable within Ethiopia’s context.

Since the inception of its first National Nutrition Strategy in 2008, the government has consistently prioritized nutrition, embedding it within a comprehensive policy framework. This framework includes pivotal initiatives such as the National Food and Nutrition Policy 2018, the National Nutrition Program II 2016, and the National Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture Strategy 2016, among others. These policies collectively aim to ensure the universal availability, accessibility, and consumption of diverse, safe, adequate, and nutritious foods.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Despite these extensive efforts, Ethiopia continues to grapple with significant food and nutrition security challenges. The nation’s reliance on productive safety net programs, which support approximately 8 million people annually, underscores the persistent vulnerability of many communities. Alarmingly high rates of stunting, underweight, and wasting among children, coupled with micronutrient deficiencies and undernutrition among women of reproductive age, further highlight the urgent need for effective interventions.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In response to these challenges, the NSA CASE project was launched to bolster the government's efforts in ensuring food and nutrition security. This project focuses on establishing a robust system to guide food and nutrition security initiatives, including strengthening financing mechanisms, developing a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework, enhancing nutrition coordination capacity, and facilitating technology and innovation transfer. In collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, the NSA CASE project developed the NSA model village concept, designed to serve as a practical demonstration of nutrition-sensitive agriculture. The establishment of the NSA model village in 2022 in Tur5fe Wotera Elemo Kebele, Shashemene, represents a tangible step towards implementing these strategies.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The model village prioritizes food and nutrition security, Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), and women's empowerment, among other interventions that directly impact household nutrition. A comprehensive baseline assessment conducted prior to the intervention revealed the kebele's significant agricultural potential, supported by favorable bi-modal rainy seasons. However, the assessment also highlighted challenges such as low productivity due to inadequate agricultural inputs, poor farming practices, soil fertility issues, and limited irrigation. These challenges led to restricted diets, with approximately 90% of the population consuming fewer than four food groups.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">To evaluate the model village's impact, inform future interventions, and extract valuable lessons, a follow-on assessment is essential. This assessment will measure progress against the 13 graduation criteria outlined in the NSA model village implementation guidelines, serving as benchmarks for effectiveness. By examining the model village's practical application, the assessment will provide critical insights into its status and guide future strategies, promoting the adoption of effective NSA approaches across Ethiopia. Specifically, this Terms of Reference (TOR) has been developed to hire a consultant to document the progress and best practices observed in the NSA Model Village. This documentation will serve as a valuable resource for scaling successful interventions and informing future initiatives aimed at strengthening food and nutrition security in Ethiopia.<br><br><strong>ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES SAVE THE CHILDREN&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Assign technical staff in the Save the Children country office, MoA, BoA, Zone and Woreda to coordinate the assessment and support data collection. &nbsp;</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Provide project documents, including the NSA MV guide, standard operating procedures and project and annual performance reports.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Provide quantitative (household survey questionnaire) and qualitative data collection (FGD and KII guides) tools.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Review revised and translated data collection tools</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Review scripted quantitative data collection tools</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Lead the MV assessment process.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Coordinate weekly virtual check-ins of the process of data collection and assessment and in-person meetings as necessary.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Supervise the data collection process and provide any needed support.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Crosscheck audio-recorded data with transcribed data.</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Review and comment on the draft MV assessment report, 2-pager, and presentation.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Organize the validation workshop for MV assessment finding dissemination.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>For Further Information Please refer this link </strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-b-b_tBOh8o8lI4PnyokC_mT3330C6jI/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=106079034217001464744&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true\"><strong>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-b-b_tBOh8o8lI4PnyokC_mT3330C6jI/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=106079034217001464744&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true</strong></a></p>", "recruiter": "Save the Children", "location": "Addis Ababa", "date_posted": "2025-03-12", "job_deadline": "2025-03-26", "category": ["Agriculture", "Research and Development", "Social Sciences and Community Service"]},

EWLA aims to strengthen its MEL system, and the existence of these two crucial documents is essential for achieving by measuring and managing EWLA’s goal.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The&nbsp;<strong>guideline</strong>&nbsp;will provide direction on how to monitor and evaluate programs effectively while promoting and maintaining their quality. They will outline processes for managing data, conducting data collection, and capturing lessons learned to enhance program quality.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The&nbsp;<strong>framework</strong>, on the other hand, will focus on assessing outcomes and impacts, emphasizing the results, effectiveness, and success of all EWLA projects. It will serve as a tool for partners and the M&amp;E team to evaluate whether planned activities are being implemented in alignment with the result chain during the implementation phase. EWLA has developed framework which incorporated Theory of Change and Result-Framework which needs to be standardized by reviewing.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Additionally, the framework will ensure the availability of reliable and timely information for reflection, learning, and Evidence Based-Decision-making (EBDM).&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Both the guideline and framework documents are expected to be developed separately, based on EWLA’s newly revised Strategic Plan (2025–2029). The Strategic Plan includes specific indicators that need to be linked to the development of the framework. EWLA is adopting and striving to apply&nbsp;<strong>Result-Based Management (RBM)</strong>&nbsp;principles.

Our subsidiaries include Amref Flying Doctors, Amref Enterprises Limited, and the Amref International University.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Our organization is driven by its vision to bring lasting health change in Africa and its mission to catalyze and drive community-led and people-centered health systems while addressing social determinants of health. Amref believes that the power to transform Africa's health lies within its communities and therefore strives to ensure that health systems are functioning at an optimal level and communities are empowered to hold these systems accountable for the delivery of high-quality and affordable health care.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Amref has been active in Ethiopia since the 1960s and became fully operational as of 2002. We have been partnering with the Ethiopian government and local communities to co-create solutions and implement diverse health and development project portfolios throughout the country for over twenty years. Aligning with the national Health Sector Transformation Plan II (HSTP II), we work to ensure health equity by serving women and children, reaching the most disadvantaged, inaccessible communities including pastoralist communities and placing an emphasis on youth development.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Our programs are designed to support community level interventions while strengthening health systems at the regional and national levels. With an integrated and multi-sectoral approach, Amref strategically addresses cross-cutting issues through these programmatic focus areas.&nbsp;</p><h2>Project Background&nbsp;</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">AFD Kefeta project works towards empowering youth to advance their own economic, civic, and social development. This project approach applies integrated skill building, financial access, technical skills training, youth-friendly health services, and opportunities to participate in and lead social and community issues. Kefeta Plus plans to reach more than 500,000 young people (15-29 years old, 55% of female) by designing youth centered interventions in youth centers and career development centers at Higher Education Institutions, health centers, public universities and TVET colleges. The project activities are thus divided into three strata (civic, economic and social) which correspond to the three specific objectives of the project, namely: (i) SO1: Strengthening the capacity of young people to defend their rights, (ii) SO2: The creation of new economic opportunities for young people and (iii) SO3: Young people's access to more appropriate health services. The project applies to a transformative and inclusive approach in addressing gender equality and inclusion issues and achieving and promoting positive and sustainable change.</p><h2>Major project Indicators&nbsp;</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Project objective verifiable indicators as stated in the project document</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>INDICATORS</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>R1.1</strong> : Number of individuals receiving civic education through training&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>A. 1.1.1</strong> : Percentage of youth who participate in civil society activities as a result of soft skills and life skills training or project initiatives</td></tr><tr><td><strong>R.1.2.</strong> : Number of young people who declare having improved their personal effectiveness at the end of the training&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>A.1.2.1</strong> : Number of civil society organizations (CSOs) benefiting from the project engaged in advocacy interventions.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>A.1.2.2</strong>:&nbsp; Rate of increase in the level of civic engagement and/or political participation of participants following participation in a project activity&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>R2.1</strong> : Number of people having a new job following participation in the KEFETA project&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>A.2.1.1</strong> : Percentage of people who improved their soft skills after participating in the KEFETA project.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>A.2.1.2. </strong>: Number of host country higher education institutions benefiting from capacity building support under the project&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>A.2.1.3 </strong>: Number of partnerships concluded to support youth employment and create youth-friendly services</td></tr><tr><td><strong>R2.2</strong> Number of women having access to economic opportunities after the training&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Number of people who improved their hard skills and work-related skills</td></tr><tr><td><strong>A.2.2.1</strong> : Total number of clients benefiting from financial services provided by financial intermediaries</td></tr><tr><td><strong>R3.1</strong> The prevalence rate of modern contraceptives among young people has increased</td></tr><tr><td><strong>A3.1.1</strong> : Percentage of AFD-assisted service delivery site providing family planning (FP) counseling and/or services</td></tr><tr><td><strong>A.3.1.2</strong> : Number of health care providers trained on SRH/FP, including SGBV</td></tr><tr><td><strong>A 3.2</strong> The proportion of young people declaring that they have basic knowledge on contraceptive methods&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>A3.2.1 </strong>Number of young people who received SRH services health and family planning services and/or counseling&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>A.3.2.2</strong> :Number of vulnerable young people connected to services adapted to their needs</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>Objectives of the project</h2><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Overall objective</strong>: Empower Ethiopian youth to promote their own economic, civic and social development.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Specific objectives</strong>:&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">1.

WI works towards the achievement of this goal by improving the service provision capacity of community level health care providers through training and providing them with user friendly systems and tools in service delivery and client management.<br><br>The primary goal of Willows International is to help women, particularly those in disadvantaged situations, through increasing their access to quality services by developing and implementing systems that improve the service provider’s effectiveness and performances. We improve service providers’ knowledge and skills at the community level in two areas: 1) By updating their counseling and interpersonal communication skills as well as their reproductive health knowledge, 2) By training them and providing post training supervision and support in the use of user-friendly client management tools that help them prioritize their services to the clients and enable them to perform timely follow-ups. To achieve this, Willows International has developed a unique client management system and set of tools called the Willows Box System (WBS) that enables Health Extension Workers (HEWs) to provide customized counseling, referral, and follow-up services to women and men they serve and to improve the way they manage their time and services. This intervention not only achieves more effective and efficient HEW services, but it also results in client behavioral change in seeking and obtaining contraceptive and abortion services that lasts beyond the implementation period of the Willows programs, throughout their reproductive years.<br><br>Since 2017, the Ministry of Health (MoH) has implemented the WBS in selected regions and districts to enhance the performance of Health Extension Workers (HEWs). Willows will collaborate closely with the MoH, Regional Health Bureaus (RHBs) and District Health Offices (DHOs) to further refine, standardize and customize the WBS, ensuring its effectiveness and impact. Designed to transform family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH) service delivery at the community level, the WBS strengthens HEWs’ interpersonal communication (IPC) and counseling skills while equipping HEWs with tools to effectively and efficiently manage their clients. It enables HEWs to provide timely, tailored, and comprehensive FP/RH services.<br><br>Willows International achieves its goals through implementing programs in various countries.
